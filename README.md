# Discord4Gradle [![Download](https://jitpack.io/v/Discord4J-Addons/Discord4J-Gradle-Plugin.svg?style=flat-square)](https://jitpack.io/#Discord4J-Addons/Discord4J-Gradle-Plugin)
A gradle plugin which allows for gradle builds to have Discord4J integration.

## Adding the plugin to your `build.gradle` file:

NOTE: This requires Discord4J to be added to your `build.gradle` as a project dependency. [See here for instructions on how to do that](https://github.com/austinv11/Discord4J#with-gradle).
```groovy
apply plugin: 'discord4j' //Applies the gradle plugin

discord { //This block allows you to configure the plugin
    apiKey = "INSERT_API_KEY_HERE" //The bot token, this is used to log into a bot account when running the "modules" task
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { //This repository is required to apply the plugin
            url  "https://jitpack.io"
        }
    }
    dependencies { //This adds the plugin as a dependency in your build script
        classpath 'com.github.Discord4J-Addons:Discord4J-Gradle-Plugin:INSERT_VERSION_HERE'
    }
}
```

## Using the plugin:

Available tasks:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `modules` | This packages your project and runs it as an external Discord4J module. |
| `cleanModules` | This cleans all files generated by the `modules` task. |
